Use the following Git commands to manage version control and push changes to your GitHub repository.

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `git status` | Shows the current state of your working directory (changes, untracked files, etc.). |
| `git add .` | Stages all changed files for the next commit. |
| `git add <filename>` | Stages a specific file only. |
| `git commit -m "your message"` | Commits the staged changes with a message describing the update. |
| `git push` | Uploads your local commits to the GitHub repository. |
| `git pull` | Fetches and merges the latest changes from GitHub into your local branch. |
| `git log` | Displays the history of commits in the current branch. |
| `git clone <repo-url>` | Creates a local copy of a GitHub repository. |
| `git branch -M main` | Renames the current branch to `main` (used in setup). |
| `git remote add origin <repo-url>` | Connects your local repo to a GitHub remote repository. |
| `git remote -v` | Shows the current remote repository URLs. |
